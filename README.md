# Portfolio. 

<p>This is a web page designed to expose a little bit about my story, my progression over time, and show some projects that i've been worked on.</p>

### The page is developed with:

- React & Next.js (implementing App Router & Server Actions).
- TypeScript.
- Tailwind CSS.
- Framer Motion.
- Resend, React-Email.
- React-hot-toast.

<p>This was my first attempt to implement Framer Motion. It helped me bring a deeper and more immersive user experience, and it's also quite simple to use.</p>
<p>Some of the text content was manually written in a data file to quickly change it without wasting time searching and looking through lines of code.</p>
<p>This project was a personal challenge to prove and implement the knowledge I had acquired up to this point in my learning process as a <strong>Software Developer.</strong></p>

### What have I learned on this project?

- Concepts like **Intersection Observer** and its applications.
- Writing and implementing **custom hooks**.
- Using the **Next.js App router and Server Actions**.
- Gaining confidence in utilizing **Tailwind**.
- Basics of **TypeScript** data types and their workflow.
- Using and applying **Context API** to implement dark mode.
